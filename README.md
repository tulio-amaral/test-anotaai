# 🔧 Installation

**You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) first, then in order to clone the project via HTTPS, run this command:**

```git clone https://github.com/tulio-amaral/test-anotaai```

**Install dependencies**

```yarn install```

**You will need have a Postgres server setup so you can start the server. For this project I used:**

```
    port: 5432,
    username: postgres,
    password: docker,
```

**You will also need to create 2 diferents database. One is used to run the server and the other is for the tests. For this project I used:**

```
desafio_anotaai
desafio_anotaai_test
```

# 🚀 Scripts
**Run server**

```yarn dev:server```

**Run tests**

```yarn test```
